Usage
The project includes a Program.cs file with a basic Main method. You can modify this file and add your own C# code to experiment with different concepts. The Main method serves as the entry point of the program and will be executed when the application runs.

Here's an example of the default code in Program.cs:

csharp
Copy code
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Add your code here
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
Feel free to replace the existing code with your own logic and run the program to see the output.
